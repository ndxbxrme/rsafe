rsafe
=====
a place to keep your passwords  
still under development  
but if you want to have a mess around
```
git clone https://github.com/ndxbxrme/rsafe.git
cd rsafe
npm install
npm link
```
then you should be off to the races  

```
rsafe setup
rsafe login
rsafe set my.first.key
rsafe set my.first.anotherkey
rsafe list my.first
rsafe get my.first.key
```
etc  
have fun
